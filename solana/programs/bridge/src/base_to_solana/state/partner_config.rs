/// Partner signer configuration used to authorize actions on the Baseâ†’Solana bridge.
///
/// This account is owned and written by the external "partner" program and is
/// referenced by this bridge program when verifying that a partner has approved
/// a given operation (e.g. registering an output root). The account stores a
/// small, fixed-capacity set of EVM addresses that are allowed to sign. During
/// runtime, a separate configuration on the main `Bridge` account specifies the
/// partner approval threshold that must be met.
///
/// How it is used:
/// - The `register_output_root` instruction recovers unique EVM signer
///   addresses from provided Secp256k1 signatures, then calls
///   `PartnerConfig::count_approvals` to count how many of those addresses
///   appear in this allowlist.
/// - The resulting count is compared against
///   `bridge.partner_oracle_config.required_threshold` to enforce that enough
///   partner signers have approved the action.
///
/// Notes:
/// - EVM addresses are stored as raw 20-byte values `[u8; 20]`.
/// - Only the first `signer_count` entries in `signers` are considered valid.
/// - Up to 16 signers are supported to keep the account small and rent-cheap.
